Every plugin earned its place. Every keybinding has a reason. This is a Neovim configuration built for real-world, full-stack development — with custom integrations you won't find anywhere else.

## Why This Config

Most Neovim configs fall into two camps: minimal setups that leave you missing IDE features, or bloated distributions that take seconds to start and fight you at every turn.

This config rejects that trade-off. It loads **45+ plugins in ~25ms** through aggressive lazy loading, so you get the full power of LSP, AI completion, Git workflows, and fuzzy finding without ever waiting for your editor. It stays fast because every plugin is loaded on demand — zero blocking at startup.

But speed is just the baseline. What makes this config different is what it connects to. Todoist tasks, Jira tickets, GitHub repositories, and a personal journal system are all accessible without leaving the editor. These aren't wrappers around CLI tools — they're purpose-built Lua modules talking directly to APIs, designed around how a working developer actually moves through their day.

## Feature Highlights

### Intelligent Code Completion

Rust-powered completion engine (Blink.cmp) paired with GitHub Copilot for instant, context-aware suggestions. AI chat through CopilotChat and OpenCode for code review, debugging, and refactoring — all inline.

### Full Language Server Protocol

20+ language servers auto-installed and managed through Mason. TypeScript, Java, Python, Go, Rust, Lua, and more — each with formatting, diagnostics, and code actions configured out of the box.

### Advanced Navigation

Snacks.picker for modern fuzzy finding. Yazi as a full terminal file manager. Hop and Leap for instant cursor movement. Arrow for persistent file bookmarks. 175+ keybindings organized by logical groups.

### Complete Git Workflow

LazyGit for visual staging and commits. Fugitive for Git commands. GitSigns for inline blame and diff indicators. Custom branch creation with automatic Jira ticket linking.

### AI-Powered Development

OpenCode.nvim with operator-based context selection. CopilotChat for explain, review, fix, and optimize workflows. WTF.nvim for AI-driven diagnostic debugging.

### Polished UI

Catppuccin color scheme. Custom bubble-style statusline. Contextual breadcrumbs via Dropbar. Dashboard, floating terminals, and notification system through Snacks.nvim.

## Standout Integrations

These aren't plugins — they're custom Lua modules built from scratch, talking directly to external APIs.

**Todoist** -- Full API integration for task management. Browse projects, filter by priority, create and complete tasks, all from a floating picker inside Neovim.

**Jira** -- Create tickets and link branches to issues without opening a browser. Branch names auto-format with Jira ticket codes for traceability.

**GitHub** -- Repository management, organization switching, and PR workflows. Clone, browse, and manage repos across multiple GitHub orgs from the command line.

**Journal** -- A personal journaling system with timestamped entries. Quick-capture thoughts, meeting notes, and daily logs without leaving your editor.

## Architecture

This config follows a strict modular architecture: core settings are isolated from plugin configurations, and custom productivity features live in their own namespace. Nothing is tangled together — every module can be understood, modified, or removed independently.
